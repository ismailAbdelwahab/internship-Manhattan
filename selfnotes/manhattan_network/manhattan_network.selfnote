######## Manhattan network: ###################################
Let T be a set of points.
A manhattan network on T (called N) is composed of:
	1 - Vertical and horizontal edges.
	2 - Any couple of points p and q are linked together.
		(ie. ∃ a path between p and q, ∀(p and q) With p!=q)

######## Minimal manhattan network: ###########################
Let N' be a minimal manhattan network,
	1) N' respect the Manhattan network's properties,
	2) The sum of the length of all edges is minimal.
