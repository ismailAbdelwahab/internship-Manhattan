Noted: N = (V, E)

This is a network that is composed with:
	1) A finite set of terminals (in R**2) V.
	2) A finite set of vertical and horizontal edges 
		(that connects two terminals) E.
The size of a path is the sum of the length of every edges that compose it.

A manhattan path between p and q two terminals,
is an l1-path with it's length equal to d1 between p and q.
